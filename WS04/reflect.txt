1. Why do you think selection is an extremely important concept in programming? Provide three (3) examples 
from your program (Part-2) where you use it and how it influenced your solution.
Answer: Selection plays a vital role in thw world of programming. In programming, the program is not confined to one single logic, it always have multiple choices from which we need to make it work in whichever condition it fits. In order to fulfil it we need the concept of selection. We can make these selections using if,else and if-else-if commands and can also use different type of loops.Without using these selection in our program, it will become very difficult for us to reach the final outcome of any code.
if (pick > apples)
           {
              printf("You picked too many... only %d more APPLE(S) are needed.\n",apples);
           }
else if (pick <= 0)
           {
              printf("ERROR: You must pick at least 1!\n");
           }
else
           {
              apples = apples - pick;
              if (apples == 0)
                 {
                    printf("Great, that's the apples done!\n");
                 }
               else
                 {
                    printf("Looks like we still need some APPLES...\n");
                 }
           }
Here, i used three choices according to the value entered and influence and make changes to my code according to the solution mentioned in the question to us.


2. What is a nested construct? Identify two (2) different examples from your program (Part-2) where you applied this and describe how the logic is executed in language a non-technical person would understand.
Answer: Nested contruct means a block inside a block.When we add a construct inside the existing construct, that is what meant by nested construct. This simply reduces the complexity of code and make the logics and calculation much more simpler with less complexity.Different type of selections and loops can be constructed with each other. I would like to show an example of nested construct from my code:
Example1:	 do
        	{
            	printf("How many PEARS do you need? : ");
            	scanf("%d", &pears);
            	if (pears < 0)
            	{
                	printf("ERROR: Value must be 0 or more.\n");
            	}
        	} while (pears < 0);
        	printf("\n");
Description: In example 1, i used do while loop, inside this loop i inserted if statement which is an example of nested construct


Example 2:
			if (oranges > 0)
        {
            do
            {
                printf("Pick some ORANGES... how many did you pick? : ");
                scanf("%d", &pick);
                if (pick > oranges)
                {
                    printf("You picked too many... only %d more ORANGE(S) are needed.\n",oranges);
                }

                else if (pick <= 0)
                {
                    printf("ERROR: You must pick at least 1!\n");
                }

                else
                {
                    oranges = oranges - pick;

                    if (oranges == 0)
                    {
                        printf("Great, that's the oranges done!\n");
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        printf("Looks like we still need some ORANGES...\n");
                    }
                }
            } while (oranges > 0);
	 }
Description: In this block I used multiple nested construct,i.e in do while loop I used if-else-if and inside that there is another if else block.



3. What is your favourite iteration construct and why? Compare your favourite to each of the other possible iteration constructs to backup your reasons. In addition, provide a concrete example from your solution for Part-2.
Answer: For loop is my favourite iteration construct beacuse it is very simple to use and with less lines of code as compared to other loops. Initialisation,conditional and update statement can be written in one line only. But in case of while loop which is also called entry controlled condition is decalred at the beginning of the loop then the whole code comes, whereas do while loop which is also called exit controlled loop in which the condition is checked at the bottom of the loop.
 do
        {
            printf("How many APPLES do you need? : ");
            scanf("%d", &apples);
            if (apples < 0)
            {
                printf("ERROR: Value must be 0 or more.\n");
            }
        } while (apples < 0);
        printf("\n");
Other possible writing pattern for this particular blocks are:Using do-while loop
apples=0;
while (apples < 0)
{
	printf("How many APPLES do you need? : ");
     scanf("%d", &apples);
     if (apples < 0)
            {
                printf("ERROR: Value must be 0 or more.\n");
            }
}

Other method: Using for loop:
int apples=-1;
    for(int i = 0; apples< 0;i++)
    {
        printf("How many APPLES do you need? : ");
        scanf("%d",&apples);
        if (apples < 0)
        {
            printf("ERROR: Value must be 0 or more.\n");
        }
    }
