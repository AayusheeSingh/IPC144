1. What you have learned in completing this workshop? (do not leave anything out!)
Answer:Through workshop-1 I learned many basic C language commands. First of all i came to know about the importance of #include statement which is used in running the C code as it adds the content of some other file into the source code of the running program. Morover the C language provides us with some in-built library functions, for instance <stdio.h> which is a header file. After starting the program in part-1 I learnt how to print anything,its syntax is using printf("Print anything");.Here printf is the main output function of C language to print the data. So using this I completed the part-1 of the workshop according to the instructions given in the question.Another important thing in part 1 was the use of \n which is used to add space to the existing content and move the cursor to the next line.
In part-2 I came to know about \t which gives Tab space.Further learnt how to print (\,",%) signs in printf command.
